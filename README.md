# test-demo

I'm showing students how to setup repositories in GitHub.  Test nate's contribution.

I'm adding something on the new branch

I'm adding some code to the readme as Nathan.

I'm adding some different code as test-nate to conflict with the other code that was added.

Adding new text from new feature branch.
